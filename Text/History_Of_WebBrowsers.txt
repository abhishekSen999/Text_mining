A web browser is a application software designed to enable users to access , retrieve and view documents and other resources on the internet.The method of accessing a particular page or content is achieved by entering its address, known as a Uniform Resource Identifier or URI. This may be a web page, image, video, or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.
Precursors to the web browser emerged in the form of hyperlinked applications during the mid and late 1980s, and following these, Tim Berners-Lee is credited with developing in 1990 both the first web server, and the first web browser, called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and later renamed Nexus.

Timeline of web browsers.
1990 – The WorldWideWeb (not to be confused with the World Wide Web) was the first browser ever created by W3C 	Director Tim Berners-Lee, then renamed Nexus to differentiate from the actual World Wide Web. Unlike today, 	this was the only browser and the only way to access the web.
1992 – Lynx was a texted-based browser that couldn’t display any graphic content.
1993 – Mosaic was the first browser to allow images embedded in text making it “the world’s first most popular 	browser”.
1994 – A noticeable improvement to Mosaic came Netscape Navigator.
1995 – Internet Explorer made its debut as Microsoft’s first web browser.
1996 – Opera started as a research project in 1994 that finally went public two years later. This was also arguably the 	beginning of the browser wars, mainly between IE 3 and Navigator 3 as Internet Explorer inched ahead with new 	capabilities.
2003 – Apple’s Safari browser was released specifically for Macintosh computers instead of Navigator.
2004 – Mozilla launched Firefox as Netscape Navigator faded out.
2007 – Mobile Safari was introduced as Apple’s mobile web browser and continues to dominate the iOS market.
2008 – Google Chrome appeared to soon take over the browser market.
2011 – Opera Mini was released to focus on the fast-growing mobile browser market.
2015 – Microsoft Edge was born to combat Google.

The browser acts as a client to contact the web server and request information. When one searches something on Google and click on a link or enter a URL in the address bar, the web server locates and sends the information one just requested to the web browser.It does this by first performing a Domain Name System (DNS) look to find the correct IP address. After that, it sends a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request to the web server, which sends a response with HTML, CSS, and other content files to the browser. The browser then communicates with the network to ask for all the documents that make up the page. Browsers can also display other more advanced material like interactivity and animations made with JavaScript with internal JavaScript interpreters.

The World Wide Web Consortium is the standards organization for the web, which has a set of guidelines for browsers to adhere certain to HTML and DOM specifications.
Because it’s not a strict set of rules, they can be interpreted differently by different rendering engines. This is largely why one sees discrepancies in browser experiences. Browsers can conform the specification while still abiding by their own rules, which can cause compatibility issues.

Browser wars have been happening since Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator went up against each other to be best in class browser of the 90’s. Netscape had previously been leading the market, but with the release of Internet Explorer 3, Microsoft took the lead. Since it was automatically included in the Windows OS, it became the standard for many desktop users.

The same situation happened when Safari came to be in 2003. Whereas Macintosh users were previously on IE or Navigator, Safari being preinstalled in Apple’s OS mean that it gained control of that desktop market.

After some time of IE beating out Navigator, Netscape made the code for the browser open source and gave it to Mozilla. However, when Firefox was introduced in 2004, it saw a rapid rise in popularity for a few years. That is until Google Chrome was released in 2008 and quickly fought to be the favored browser, which we still see today.

Of course, in between, we’ve also seen increased mobile use and differences in mobile browsers as well as the introduction of HTML5 and CSS3. This all contributes to the browser wars between Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and, recently, Edge to be the preferred browser for surfing the World Wide Web.
